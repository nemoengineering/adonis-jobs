# Observability and Monitoring

AdonisJS jobs package provides built-in observability features to help you monitor and manage your job queues effectively. This includes integration with Prometheus for metrics and Opentelemetry for tracing.

## Prometheus Metrics

The package expose a custom collector for the package [`@julr/adonisjs-prometheus`](https://github.com/Julien-R44/adonisjs-prometheus) to collect metrics from your jobs queues.

Make sure to install and configure the `@julr/adonisjs-prometheus` package in your AdonisJS application first, and then, add the following collector to your `config/prometheus` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@julr/adonisjs-prometheus'
import { bullmqCollector } from '@nemoventures/adonis-jobs/metrics'

import env from '#start/env'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  collectors: [
    // ... other collectors
    bullmqCollector(),
  ],
})
```

Once enabled, you should be able to access the metrics at the endpoint defined in your `config/prometheus.ts` file, typically `/metrics`.

### Exposed Metrics

The BullMQ collector exposes the following Prometheus metrics:

| Metric Name                  | Type      | Description                                                                                | Labels           |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `bullmq_job_count`           | Gauge     | Number of jobs in the queue by state                                                       | `queue`, `state` |
| `bullmq_job_processing_time` | Histogram | Processing time for completed jobs (from processing start until completed) in milliseconds | `queue`, `job`   |
| `bullmq_job_completion_time` | Histogram | Completion time for completed jobs (from creation until completed) in milliseconds         | `queue`, `job`   |

#### Metric Details

- **`bullmq_job_count`**: Shows the current number of jobs in each state (waiting, active, completed, failed, etc.) for each queue
- **`bullmq_job_processing_time`**: Measures how long jobs take to process once they start running
- **`bullmq_job_completion_time`**: Measures the total time from job creation to completion, including waiting time

#### Default Histogram Buckets

Both histogram metrics use the following default buckets (in milliseconds):
`[100, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000, 30000, 60000]`

You can customize these buckets when configuring the collector:

```typescript
bullmqCollector({
  processingTimeBuckets: [50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 5000],
  completionTimeBuckets: [100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 60000]
})
```

## Opentelemetry Tracing

This package also supports Opentelemetry for distributed tracing of your job processing.

Under the hood, it uses the `bullmq-otel` package created by the BullMQ team, which automatically instruments job processing and emits spans for each job.

For every job processed, we are internally adding a `bullmq.job.name` attribute to the span, which contains the job class name.

Make sure to check out the [BullMQ OpenTelemetry documentation](https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/telemetry/getting-started) if you are new to using OpenTelemetry as it provides a quick start guide for setting up tracing in your application.

## Job Logging

For logging inside jobs, we provide a child logger instance that automatically includes the trace ID. This logger can be accessed via the `this.logger` property inside your job classes.
You can use it like this:

```typescript
import { Job } from '@nemoventures/adonis-jobs'

export default class MyJob extends Job {
  async handle() {
    // Use this.logger to log messages with trace context
    this.logger.info('Processing job', { jobId: this.id })

    // Your job logic here
  }
}
```

You will quickly notice that the logs generated by this logger aren't included in your BullMQ dashboard, wether you are using QueueDash or any other dashboard. This is expected, as the logger you are using is the one provided by AdonisJS, Pino, and BullMQ provides its own logger that is used to log job events.

To fix that, you can enable the `multiLogger` option in your `config/queue.ts` file:

```typescript
const queueConfig = defineConfig({
  // ...
  multiLogger: true,
})
```

Now, the logs you generate using `this.logger` will be sent to your Pino targets but also to the BullMQ logger, which will then be displayed in your dashboard.

### Logging in Services used by Jobs

If you want to also log to both BullMQ and Pino, from other service classes that are used by your jobs, you'll need to use dependency injection with the `@inject` decorator to ensure these logs are also sent to BullMQ when `multiLogger` is enabled.

Here is a quick example of how to set this up:

```typescript
import { inject } from '@adonisjs/core'
import { Job } from '@nemoventures/adonis-jobs'

import { EmailService } from '#services/test_service'

@inject()
export default class MyJob extends Job {
  constructor(protected testService: EmailService) {
    super()
  }

  async handle(): Promise<void> {
    // This will be logged to both Pino and BullMQ
    this.logger.info('Starting file write job')

    // The service can also use logging that will be properly routed
    await this.email.processData(this.data.data)
  }
}
```

And in your service:

```typescript
import { inject } from '@adonisjs/core'
import { Logger } from '@adonisjs/core/logger'

@inject()
export class TestService {

  /**
   * Here, the MultiLogger will be automatically injected when
   * injected from a Job.
   *
   * If the service is also used outside of a Job context,
   * no worries, the logger will still be available
   * and will log to Pino targets only.
   */
  constructor(protected logger: Logger) {}

  async processData(data: string): Promise<void> {
    // This log will be sent to both Pino and BullMQ when multiLogger is enabled
    this.logger.info('Processing data in service', { dataLength: data.length })

    // Your service logic here
  }
}
```
