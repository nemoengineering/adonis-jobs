# Queue Management

Now that you have setup your jobs, that you can dispatch them, we need to run a worker to process those jobs.

A worker is another process that run aside your AdonisJS application and is responsible for processing jobs from the queue. You can run multiple workers to process jobs concurrently, and you can even run workers on different machines to scale your job processing.

## Management Commands

### Start Workers

Start processing jobs on your queues:

```bash
# Start workers for all queues
node ace queue:work

# Start workers for specific queues
node ace queue:work --queue emails
node ace queue:work --queue emails,reports,background
```

### Clean Queues

Removes jobs in a specific state, but keeps jobs within a certain grace period.

```bash
# Clean completed jobs older than 1 hour
node ace queue:clean --type completed --grace 3600

# Clean failed jobs with limit
node ace queue:clean --type failed --limit 100

# Clean specific queue
node ace queue:clean --queue emails --type completed
```

Options:
- `--type`: `completed`, `wait`, `active`, `paused`, `prioritized`, `delayed`, `failed`
- `--grace`: Age in seconds (for time-based cleaning)
- `--limit`: Maximum number of jobs to clean
- `--queue`: Specific queue to clean

### Clear Queues

Completely remove all jobs from a queue :

```bash
# Clear all jobs from default queue
node ace queue:clear

# Clear specific queue
node ace queue:clear --queue background-tasks

# Clear without confirmation
node ace queue:clear --queue critical --force
```

### Drain Queues

Removes all jobs that are waiting or delayed, but not active, waiting-children, completed or failed

```bash
# Drain default queue
node ace queue:drain

# Drain specific queue
node ace queue:drain --queue notifications
```
