---

# Installation

Since `@nemoventures/adonis-jobs` supports both BullMQ and BullMQ Pro, you need to install the appropriate package based on your needs.

```bash
# For BullMQ (open-source version)
npm install bullmq
# For BullMQ Pro (enterprise version)
npm install @taskforcesh/bullmq-pro
```

## Install package

:::warning[Note]
Make sure you have already installed and configured `@adonisjs/redis` in your AdonisJS application, as this package relies on it for connection management.
:::

Install and configure the package in your AdonisJS application.

```bash
node ace configure @nemoventures/adonis-jobs
```

This command will:
- Install the package
- Create the queue configuration file at `config/queue.ts`
- Set up the necessary providers/commands in your `adonisrc.ts`

## Verify Installation

Create a test job to verify everything is working:

```bash
node ace make:job test
```

This should create a job file at `app/jobs/test_job.ts`. If successful, you're ready to start using the package!

## Next Steps

Now that you have the package installed, learn how to [configure queues and workers](/guides/configuration) for your application.
