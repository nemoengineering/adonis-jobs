# Queue Dashboard

The package includes integration with [QueueDash](https://www.queuedash.com/), a web-based dashboard for monitoring and managing your BullMQ queues in real-time

## Setup

Add the dashboard routes to your `start/routes.ts` file:

```typescript
import router from '@adonisjs/core/services/router'
import { queueDashUiRoutes } from '@nemoventures/adonis-jobs/ui/queuedash'

// Add queue dashboard routes
router.group(() => {
  queueDashUiRoutes().prefix('/queue')
}).prefix('/admin')
```

This will make the dashboard available at `/admin/queue`. Run your AdonisJS application and open `http://localhost:3333/admin/queue` to access the dashboard.

### Custom Authentication

Since these routes are standard AdonisJS routes, you can protect them using a authentication middleware.

```typescript
import { middleware } from '#start/kernel'

router.group(() => {
  queueDashUiRoutes().prefix('/queue')
})
  .prefix('/admin')
  .use(middleware.auth({ guards: ['basicAuth'] }))
```

### Shield Configuration

To enable job deletion and re-running directly from the dashboard, make sure to exclude the dashboard routes from CSRF protection in your config/shield.ts file. Add the /admin/queue path to the exceptRoutes array under the csrf option:

```typescript
csrf: {
  enabled: true,
  exceptRoutes: [
    '/admin/queue',
  ],
},
```
